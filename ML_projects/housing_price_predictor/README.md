# Machine Learning Regression Project

## Project Overview
This project explores different regression models to predict [target variable, e.g., "housing prices"].  
The objective is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## Dataset
- Source: [mention the source, e.g., "Kaggle Housing Dataset" or "Generated synthetic data"]
- Features: [briefly list important features]
- Target: [target variable you are predicting]

## Models Trained
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- [any others you tried]

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R² Score)

## Model Comparison
| Model                    | MAE  | MSE  | RMSE | R² Score |
|---------------------------|------|------|------|----------|
| Linear Regression         | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...      |
| Ridge Regression          | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...      |
| Random Forest Regressor   | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...      |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor| ... | ...  | ...  | ...      |
| XGBoost Regressor         | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...      |

## Conclusion
Based on the evaluation metrics, [Model Name] performed the best in predicting [target variable].  
Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or model stacking.

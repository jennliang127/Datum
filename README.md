# Datum Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, and dynamic modeling projects, that apply predictive modeling across various domains. Each folder contains specific Machine Learning prediction algorithms that make predictions on real-world datasets, the project displays here demonstrate examples of data preprocessing, prediction model training, model selection, and evaluation, and served as a record track of development workflows.
